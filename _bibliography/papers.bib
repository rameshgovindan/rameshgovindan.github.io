This produces a volumetric video consisting of a sequence of 3D frames capturing the time evolution of road traffic. 3D traffic reconstruction can help trained investigators reconstruct the scene of an accident. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of RECAP, a system that continuously and opportunistically produces 3D traffic reconstructions from multiple vehicles. RECAP builds upon prior work on point cloud registration, but adapts it to settings with minimal point cloud overlap (both in the spatial and temporal sense) and develops techniques to minimize error and computation time in multi-way registration. On-road experiments and trace-driven simulations show that RECAP can, within minutes, generate highly accurate reconstructions that have 2× or more lower errors than competing approaches.},

                  scale better than their optimal counterparts. Yet,
                  practitioners are often unaware of the performance gap between
                  a heuristic and the optimum or between two heuristics in
                  realistic scenarios. We present MetaOpt, a system that helps
                  analyze heuristics. Users specify the heuristic and the
                  optimal (or another heuristic) as input, and MetaOpt
                  automatically encodes these efficiently for a solver to find
                  performance gaps and their corresponding adversarial inputs.
                  Its suite of built-in optimizations helps it scale its
                  analysis to practical problem sizes. To show it is versatile,
                  we used MetaOpt to analyze heuristics from three domains
                  (traffic engineering, vector bin packing, and packet
                  scheduling). We found a production traffic engineering
                  heuristic can require 30\% more capacity than the optimal to
                  satisfy realistic demands. Based on the patterns in the
                  adversarial inputs MetaOpt produced, we modified the heuristic
                  to reduce its performance gap by 12.5×. We examined
                  adversarial inputs to a vector bin packing heuristic and
                  proved a new lower bound on its performance.},

  abstract = 	 {When streaming 360° video, it is possible to reduce
		  bandwidth by 5\texttimes{} with approaches that spatially
		  segment video into tiles and only stream the user's
		  viewport. Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately
		  predict a user's viewport even 2--3 seconds before
		  playback. This results in rebuffering events owing to
		  misprediction of a user's viewport or network bandwidth
		  dips, which hurts interactive experience. However, avoiding
		  rebuffering by naively skipping tiles that do not arrive by
		  the playback deadline may lead to incomplete viewports and
		  degraded experience.In this paper, we describe Dragonfly, a
		  new 360° system that preserves interactive experience by
		  avoiding playback stalls while maintaining high perceptual
		  quality. Dragonfly prudently skips tiles using a model that
		  defines an overall utility function to decide which tiles
		  to fetch, and at which qualities they should be fetched,
		  with the goal of optimizing user experience. To minimize
		  incomplete viewports, it also fetches a low quality masking
		  stream. Using a user study with 26 users and
		  emulation-based experiments we show that Dragonfly has
		  higher quality, and lower overheads, than state-of-the-art
		  360° streaming approaches. For instance, in our study,
		  65\% of sessions have a rating of 4 or higher
		  (Good/Excellent) with Dragonfly, while only 16\% of
		  sessions with Pano, and 13\% of sessions with Flare achieve

		  using a novel combination of program analysis and
		  per-instruction energy modeling. In evaluation, our

		  10\% of the ground truth for a set of mobile applications
		  from the Google Play store. Additionally, it provides
		  useful and meaningful feedback to developers that helps
		  them to understand application energy consumption behavior.

		  the energy consumption of mobile apps, developers need
		  detailed information about the energy consumption of their
		  applications. Existing techniques have drawbacks that limit
		  their usefulness or provide information at too high of a
		  level of granularity, such as components or methods. Our

		  this capacity to contending flows, a scheme we call
		  Wireless Control Protocol with Capacity estimation
		  (WCPCap). Using analysis, simulations, and real
		  deployments, we find that our designs yield rates that are
		  both fair and efficient. WCP assigns rates inversely
		  proportional to the number of bottlenecks a flow passes
		  through while remaining extremely easy to implement. And,
		  an idealized version of WCPCap is max-min fair, whereas a

  abstract	= { Emerging high-rate applications (imaging, structural
		  monitoring, acoustic localization) will need to transport
		  large volumes of data concurrently from several sensors.
		  These applications are also loss-intolerant. A key
		  requirement for such applications, then, is a protocol that
		  reliably transport sensor data from many sources to one or
		  more sinks without incurring congestion collapse. In this
		  paper, we discuss RCRT, a rate-controlled reliable
		  transport protocol suitable for constrained sensor nodes.
		  RCRT uses end-to-end explicit loss recovery, but places all
		  the congestion detection and rate adaptation functionality
		  in the sinks. This has two important advantages: efficiency
		  and flexibility. Because sinks make rate allocation
		  decisions, they are able to achieve greater efficiency

  abstract	= { Many emerging smartphone applications require position
		  information to provide location-based or context-aware
		  services. In these applications, GPS is often preferred
		  over its alternatives such as GSM/WiFi based positioning
		  systems because it is known to be more accurate. However,
		  GPS is extremely power hungry. Hence a common approach is
		  to periodically duty-cycle GPS. However, GPS duty-cycling
		  trades-off positioning accuracy for lower energy. A key
		  requirement for such applications, then, is a positioning
		  system that provides accurate position information while
		  spending minimal energy.
		  
		  In this paper, we present RAPS, rate-adaptive positioning
		  system for smartphone applications. It is based on the
		  observation that GPS is generally less accurate in urban
		  areas, so it suffices to turn on GPS only as often as
		  necessary to achieve this accuracy. RAPS uses a collection
		  of techniques to cleverly determine when to turn on GPS. It
		  uses the location-time history of the user to estimate user
		  velocity and adaptively turn on GPS only if the estimated
		  uncertainty in position exceeds the accuracy threshold. It
		  also efficiently estimates user movement using a
		  duty-cycled accelerometer, and utilizes Bluetooth
		  communication to reduce position uncertainty among
		  neighboring devices. Finally, it employs celltower-RSS
		  blacklisting to detect GPS unavailability (e.g., indoors)
		  and avoid turning on GPS in these cases. We evaluate RAPS
		  through real-world experiments using a prototype
		  implementation on a modern smartphone and show that it can
		  increase phone lifetimes by more than a factor of 3.8 over
		  an approach where GPS is always on. }

		  qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods.
		  Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop
		  heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults.
		  Estimation methods predict <A1><B0>normal<A1><B1> sensor
		  behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging
		  anomalous sensor readings as faults.
		  Time-series-analysis-based methods start with an a priori
		  model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is compared
		  against its predicted value computed using time series
		  forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based
		  methods infer a model for the <A1><B0>normal<A1><B1> sensor
		  readings using training data, and then statistically detect
		  and identify classes of faults. We find that these four
		  classes of methods sit at different points on the
		  accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be
		  highly accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on
		  the choice of parameters. Learning methods can be
		  cumbersome to train, but can accurately detect and classify
		  faults. Estimation methods are accurate, but cannot
		  classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are
		  more effective for detecting short duration faults than
		  long duration ones, and incur more false positives than the
		  other methods. We apply these techniques to four real-world
		  sensor datasets and find that the prevalence of faults as
		  well as their type varies with datasets. All four methods
		  are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor faults,
		  lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first
		  step towards automated online fault detection and

  abstract	= {Most sensor network research and software design has been
		  guided by an architectural principle that permits
		  multi-node data fusion on small-form-factor, resource-poor
		  nodes, or motes. We argue that this principle leads to
		  fragile and unmanageable systems and explore an
		  alternative. The Tenet architecture is motivated by the
		  observation that future largescale sensor network
		  deployments will be tiered, consisting of motes in the
		  lower tier and masters, relatively unconstrained 32-bit
		  platform nodes, in the upper tier. Masters provide
		  increased network capacity. Tenet constrains multinode
		  fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process
		  locally-generated sensor data. This simples application
		  development and allows mote-tier software to be reused.
		  Applications running on masters task motes by composing
		  task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet
		  implementation also contains a robust and scalable
		  networking subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably
		  delivering responses.We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion
		  application exhibits performance comparable to a
		  mote-native implementation while being considerably more
		  compact. },

		  have more recently pursued a thread in which they propose
		  precomputation of routing structures (e.g., hull trees and

		  paper we introduce a third approach, LCR, that does not
		  involve any precomputation of distributed routing
		  structures, nor full a priori planarization. Instead, LCR
		  removes non-planarities lazily only when they interfere
		  with correct geographic routing. Lazy removal of link

  abstract	= "In many sensor networks, data or events are named by
		  attributes. Many of these attributes have scalar values, so
		  one natural way to query events of interest is to use a
		  \emph{multi-dimensional} range query. An example of such a
		  range query is: ``List all events whose temperature lies
		  between 50$^\circ$ and 60$^\circ$, and whose light levels
		  lie between 10 and 15.'' Such queries are useful for
		  correlating events occurring within the network.
		  
		  In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed
		  index that scalably supports multi-dimensional range
		  queries. Our \emph{distributed index for multi-dimensional
		  data} (or DIM) uses a novel geographic embedding of a
		  classical index data structure, and is built upon the GPSR
		  geographic routing algorithm. Our analysis reveals that,
		  under reasonable assumptions about query distributions,
		  DIMs scale quite well with network size (both insertion and
		  query costs scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$). In detailed

		  scalable wide-area storage and retrieval of information,
		  and will support the rapid development of a wide variety of
		  Internet-scale applications ranging from naming systems and
		  file systems to application-layer multicast. DHT systems
		  essentially build an overlay network, but a path on the
		  overlay between any two nodes can be significantly
		  different from the unicast path between those two nodes on
		  the underlying network. As such, the lookup latency in
		  these systems can be quite high and can adversely impact
		  the performance of applications built on top of such
		  systems.
		  
		  In this paper, we discuss a random sampling technique that
		  incrementally improves lookup latency in DHT systems. Our
		  sampling can be implemented using information gleaned from
		  lookups traversing the overlay network. For this reason, we
		  call our approach {\em lookup-parasitic random sampling}
		  (LPRS). LPRS is fast, incurs little network overhead, and
		  requires relatively few modifications to existing DHT
		  systems.
		  
		  For idealized versions of DHT systems like Chord, Tapestry
		  and Pastry, we analytically prove that LPRS can result in
		  lookup latencies proportional to the diameter of the
		  network, provided the underlying physical topology has a
		  power-law latency expansion. We then validate this analysis
		  by implementing LPRS in the Chord simulator. Our
		  simulations reveal that LPRS-Chord exhibits a qualitatively
		  better latency scaling behavior relative to unmodified
		  Chord.
		  
		  Finally, we provide evidence which suggests that the
		  Internet router-level topology resembles power-law latency
		  expansion. This finding implies that LPRS has significant
		  practical applicability as a general latency reduction
		  technique for many DHT systems. This finding is also of
		  independent interest since it might inform the design of
		  latency-sensitive topology models for the Internet."
